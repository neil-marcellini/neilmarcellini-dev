      <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
          I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and started racing sailboats when 
          I was 9. In high school I started training with the US Sailing Olympic
          Development Program, and by college I had won the national championships
          and placed 10th in the world. I'm still training with the ODP but now my
          discipline is kite foiling. Sailing has provided me with amazing experiences
          and it continues to be a major part of who I am. I love the feeling of harnessing
          the wind while maintaining control and the never ending challenge of improving my
          racing performance. Striving for the optimal solution to all aspects of sailboat
          racing parallels the challenges of computer science.

          I started programming during my junior year of high school and 
          decided that Computer Science would be a valuable major to pursue in college. 
          While attending California State University Channel Islands, my interest 
          in programming grew significantly. I learned to engage in my studies as intensely
          as I had engaged in sailing. Studying calculus, physics, linear algebra,
          data structures, and machine learning, to name a few, opened up new ways for me to
          understand the world. In the summers I applied my new knowledge to sailboat race analysis
          when my coach asked for help automating his analysis workflow. The more I
          learned the more I saw the power that software engineering has to help
          humanity solve important problems.

      <h2>My Strongest Technologies</h2>
      <p class="tech-description">
        Python is my favorite programming language and the one I feel the most
        capable with. It was the first language I learned and I have always loved
        its simplicity and readability. I used it throughout college and I still
        use it with Django on the back end at Racing Alpha.

        I'm very comfortable with Javascript, HTML, and CSS 
        since I have the most experience with front end web development.
        Vue is a joy to use and I've found it to be straight forward and powerful
        while using it at Racing Alpha.

        I have used all of these technologies in school or on projects.
        I feel comfortable with them and prepared to use them for work,
        although I don't have quite as much experience using them. I'm
        eager to work with these more and learn all of their quirks and
        features!
