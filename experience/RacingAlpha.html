      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Racing Alpha is a web app for analyzing sailing GPS tracks to improve
        racing performance. GPS tracks can be uploaded manually in .gpx, .csv,
        and .fit formats. However, most users prefer to connect their Garmin
        accounts which allows Racing Alpha to automatically process every sailing
        session. By the time sailors sit down for a debrief with their coach,
        powerful analytics are at their fingertips to unlock the next level of
        racing performance.
      </p>
      <h2>My Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        I started working at Racing Alpha part time in April 2020, when my sailing 
        coach Willie Mcbride asked if I was interested in contributing. Over the 
        summer I created an algorithm to segment a GPS track into the various types 
        of sailing maneuvers; tacks, gybes, bear aways, and leeward roundings.  
        Achieving an accurate segmentation of all sailing GPS tracks without 
        wind data was a huge challenge. I tweaked the process with Willie's 
        feedback, and by the end of the summer we had something 
        that worked very well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In June 2021, after graduating from college, I began working full time.
        Since then I have added many new features and refined various parts of
        the application.
      </p>
      <p>I'm most proud of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adding a track report page showing correlations between maneuver metrics
          and maneuver loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating wind estimates throughout tracks by bisecting maneuver angles
          and interpolating between.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding a data table for races and adding
          metrics related to wind direction like VMG, and TWA
        </li>
        <li>
          Showing only the selected portion of a GPS track on the map based on the 
          selected area of the chart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Averaging wind directions across tracks to create race wind estimates.
          Using race wind estimates to create consistent wind related metrics 
          for comparison between boats in races.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cleaning up and the design by preventing text overlap, adding padding,
          and creating consistency. Making pages responsive to improve the mobile 
          user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
